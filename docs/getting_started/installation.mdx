## 1. Request API Key

We currently provide API keys to customers after a short introduction call. You can book an introduction call [here](https://cal.com/sankalp-garg/30min?user=sankalp-garg&overlayCalendar=true).

## 2. Repository Setup

Clone the required repositories:

```bash
conda create -n optexity python=3.11 nodejs
conda activate optexity
pip install optexity
brew install squid
patchright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
playwright install chrome
playwright install
playwright install-deps
```

## 3. Install the Optexity extension

- Download the Optexity extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/optexity-recorder/decfopkioendgacpglnfbkcnlibefcmc).  
- Pin the extension in your browser toolbar for easy access.  

Next, you can start a recording.
