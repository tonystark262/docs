# ðŸŽ¥ Recording Workflows

Optexity provides a **browser extension** that lets you record any workflow directly in your browser.  
This recording is then used to generate a reliable agent that can repeat the same task automatically.

## 1. Install the Extension

- Download the Optexity extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/optexity-recorder/decfopkioendgacpglnfbkcnlibefcmc).  
- Pin the extension in your browser toolbar for easy access.

## 2. Start a Recording

1. Click the **Optexity icon** in your toolbar.  
2. Select **Start Capture**.  
3. Perform the workflow in the browser exactly as you want the agent to execute it.  
   - Navigations, clicks, form fills, and scrolls will all be captured.

## 3. Stop and Save

- When finished, click **Stop Capture** in the extension popup.
- The workflow is automatically labeled with correct name, action description, goal etc.
- The recording is automatically synced with your Optexity project.
