title: Running a Workflow
description: To run a workflow in **Optexity**, you need to call the inference API with the correct endpoint, parameters, and your API key.
---


## API Endpoint

```http
POST https://api.optexity.com/api/v1/inference/call
```

## Headers
```
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Request

```json
{
  "end_point": "ecw_telephone_encounter",
  "params": {
    "facility_name": "test",
    "provider_name": "test",
    "message_content": "sample msg",
    "patient_full_name": "test",
    "encounter_datetime": "03/18/2026 08:00 PM",
    "reason_for_encounter": "test reason sample"
  }
}
```

## Notes

- `end_point` specifies the workflow to run.
- `params` contains all the inputs required for that workflow.
- Replace `<YOUR_API_KEY>` with the API key provided to you.
- Each workflow may have different parameters; check your recorded workflow for the correct parameters.

## Example curl request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.optexity.com/api/v1/inference/call \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"end_point": "ecw_telephone_encounter", "params": {"facility_name": "test", "provider_name": "test", "message_content": "sample msg", "patient_full_name": "test", "encounter_datetime": "03/18/2026 08:00 PM", "reason_for_encounter": "test reason sample"}}'
